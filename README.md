When you're ready to join formally, provide information about your organization and/or yourself by [opening an issue](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/jrost/issues/new?template=participant.md) in this repository. If you are joining as an organization, please make sure to include at least one person as serve as a representative for that organization.
1. The Joint Roadmap does not include information like email addresses in the public information collected here, so once you have filed an issue to join, please email [info@jrost.org](mailto:info@jrost.org) to provide a contact email address and make sure we know you are requesting to join.
