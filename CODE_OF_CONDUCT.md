# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of the Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools (Joint Roadmap) is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible, to create safe, professional spaces for people to collaborate and learn from each other. As such, we are committed to maintaining a high standard of professional behavior in all our activities and events, and to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of personal characteristics like gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof), or work experience.

We do not tolerate harassment of people in our community in any form. Sexual or violent language and imagery is not appropriate in our community, activities, or events. People violating our Code of Conduct may be warned or expelled from our community, activities, or events without any reimbursement at the discretion of community organizers.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community and all contributors, participants, sponsors, organizers, and guests involved in any Joint Roadmap activity or event, both online and in person, in groups and one-on-one, in public and in private. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members and participants:

*   Participate in an authentic and active way.
*   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.
*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community organizers if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
*   Remember that community event venues may be shared with other members of the public; please be respectful to all people at all locations.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

*   Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against other people.
*   Language, including jokes and personal insults, that reinforce social structures of domination related to personal characteristics like gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof), or work experience.
*   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
*   Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
*   Inappropriate or harrassing photography or recording.
*   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s explicit consent before touching them.
*   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
*   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
*   Sustained disruption of community activities or events, including meetings, talks, and presentations.
*   Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior.

Anything that makes someone feel uncomfortable could be deemed harassment. For more information about what constitutes harassment and examples, please refer to [OpenCon’s Code of Conduct in Brief](http://www.opencon2017.org/code_of_conduct), the [Gathering for Open Source Hardware’s examples of behaviour](http://openhardware.science/gosh-2017/gosh-code-of-conduct/), and the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/).

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including contributors, participants, sponsors, organizers, and guests, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If anyone engages in harassing or disruptive behavior, community organizers retain the right to take any actions to maintain a welcoming environment for everyone. Actions may include warnings, temporary bans, or permanent expulsions from the community, activity, or event without reimbursement.

## 5. Reporting Guidelines

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, or you have any other concerns, please make a report as soon as possible. Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our activities and events for everyone.

Community organizers are available to help community members and participants engage with support services and law enforcement as necessary, and to provide escorts or otherwise help people experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe.

You can make reports either personally or anonymously. All reports will be handled with discretion.

### Anonymous Reports

File [an anonymous report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4-mJSRzv9CcjBGMcNpn-TTqokY7JZ1wYmTmD1ZWS0yetZlQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) at any time. We can't follow up on anonymous reports with you directly, but we will fully investigate them and take whatever action is necessary to prevent recurrences.

### Personal Reports

You can make a personal report by email to info@jrost.org or directly in person to one or more of the Joint Roadmap's volunteer Conduct Team below, who take the lead in receiving and acting on Code of Conduct reports. After you make a report, Conduct Team members will work with you personally to review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make decisions about how to respond.

If a member of the Conduct Team is involved in the incident you are reporting, or if you do not feel comfortable making your report to specific people on the Conduct Team, reach out to any Conduct Team member or email info@jrost.org, letting us know the sensitivity of your report and we will make necessary arrangements to ensure your report is handled by people who are not involved. We will respect confidentiality to protect victims of Code of Conduct violations.

When taking a personal report, Conduct Team members will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. With your permission, they may involve other community members to ensure your report is handled properly. Once safe, they'll ask you to describe what happened. This can be upsetting, but they'll handle it respectfully, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone, you will not be left alone, and all reports will be handled with discretion.
